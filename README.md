# Image Slider Project

## Description

This web development project involves creating an image slider or carousel using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The image slider is designed to display a series of images in an interactive and visually appealing way.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the structure of the image slider.
- `index.css`: CSS file for styling the image slider.
- `index.js`: JavaScript file containing the logic for image navigation.

## Usage

1. Download or clone the project repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Functionality

- The image slider allows users to navigate through a series of images using "Previous" and "Next" buttons.
- It automatically loops back to the first image after reaching the last one.
- An automatic slideshow option transitions to the next image every 3 seconds.

## Customization

- You can replace the placeholder image URLs in the HTML file (`index.html`) with your own image URLs.
- Adjust the styling in the CSS file (`index.css`) to customize the appearance of the image slider.

## Testing

Test the image slider on both desktop and mobile devices to ensure a responsive and smooth user experience.

## Additional Features (Optional)

Feel free to explore and add extra features or styling to enhance the project. Ideas include captions, custom animations, or any creative elements.

## Submission
